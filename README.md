Academic Progress is being monitored more by the NCAA in recent years. In terms of college recruitment, this is an important factor when looking at prep athletes. As academic success is important in undergraduate, it is valuable for athletes in high school that are seeking to continue their athletic career to understand how colleges score in terms of academic success in their athletic programs.
